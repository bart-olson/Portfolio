<h1>Principal Investigator, AELSS NIAC Proposal - August 2018</h1><br>
<p>This was a proposal I submitted to the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Grant Program while I was working at Tethers Unlimited.<br>
I didn't get accepted, but it was a good continuation of the Duckweed Project I've been working on since 2015. (see school projects below)</p><br>

<h2>School Projects</h1><br>
<h3>Design Engineer - Spider Ball Solid-State Robot - EWU Engineering Dept. - June 2016 - June 2017</h3><br>
<p>This was my capstone project for my Electrical Engineering degree. We designed and fabricated a semi-spherical robot whos movement was enabled by powerful hand-made electromagnets. The concept was to create a solid-state robot that could attach itself to and move on large pieces of ferro-magnetic metal, such as ship hulls or other steel infrastructure. My capstone partner and I fabricated the entire hull, and used old microwave transformers to wind the electromagnets. The electromagnets could lift well over 150 lbs on a 24-volt supply. We also performed all the electrical design and programming to make the electromagnets fire in order, such that the robot could roll.</p>

<h3>Project Manager - Duckweed Project - Alaska Airlines Environmental Innovation Challenge - Dec 2015 - June 2016</h3><br>
