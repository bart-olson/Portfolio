<p style="text-align:center;"> Here's some of my adventures in Blender! While I'm not an expert and not promoting myself as an artist, I believe it's valuable to have tool familiarity! Plus if I want unique assets for any games I build, I'll need to make them myself, and blender has been a perfect tool for that!  </p>
