<p style="text-align:center;"> Here's some of my adventures in Blender! While I'm not an expert and not promoting myself as an artist, I believe it's valuable to have tool familiarity! Plus if I want unique assets for any games I build, I'll need to make them myself, and blender has been a perfect tool for that!  </p>

Just some simple low poly trees. I live in the forest, and have always been a little disappointed with the lack of 'realism' in low-poly tree packages. So I made my own that's a little more representative of the beat-up trees I hike through every day while I walk the dogs.
