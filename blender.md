<p style="text-align:center;"> Here's some of my adventures in Blender! While I'm not an expert and not promoting myself as an artist, I believe it's valuable to have tool familiarity! Plus if I want unique assets for any games I build, I'll need to make them myself, and blender has been a perfect tool for that!  </p>



<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Procedural Generation  </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">I love procedural generation in Blender and Unreal. There's a huge variety of things you can make this way, but it's also true that it has limitations. I've played several games that felt TOO procedural, where after visiting a small handful of places, you get the feel for the rest of the places as well, and the 'infinite exploration' promised doesn't quite feel infinite any more!  </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Low-Poly  </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">explanation of why I like/choose low-poly  </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Just some simple low poly trees. I live in the forest, and have always been a little disappointed with the lack of 'realism' in low-poly tree packages. So I made my own that's a little more representative of the beat-up trees I hike through every day while I walk the dogs.  </p>

![missing picture of rocks](https://bart-olson.github.io/Portfolio/assets/rocks.png)  
<p style="text-align:center;">Technically these should be in the procedural section but.... they're rocks. I'll be painting them a variety of colors, and implementing them as foliage in a variety of sizes, so keep an eye out for them when my game someday gets published. </p>



<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Sculpting </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Explanation of sculpting motivation  </p>

![missing picture of a sculpted something](https://bart-olson.github.io/Portfolio/assets/goblin.png)  
<p style="text-align:center;">This happy goblin is actually my first blender sculpted object! There's a few obvious issues like him not being in T/A pose, as well as the trouble I had with the feet - but otherwise I was quite happy with him, and hope to someday put him in a game!  </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">This guy was my second sculpting project. I even got to retopology and a little bit of animation on him! I started over a few times though so I don't have those files anymore.  </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Finishing these projects  </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">As I mentioned, I'm not an artist, and am not promoting myself as one. That being said, I absolutely LOVE Blender! It's such an incredible tool, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what it can do. I've dabbled in Retopology and animation as well, but found those tasks to be very taxing and not nearly as much fun as sculpting. I certainly have plans to finish these projects, but have been putting it off until I have a clearer vision of my needs and art style. 

I'm also still learning Unreal Engine, and the behavior of materials and textures between Blender and Unreal. There are pretty significant hurdles for people who are new to the area! </p>
